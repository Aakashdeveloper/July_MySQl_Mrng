primary key > Unique in the table no duplicate
foreign key> key which help to relate other table in same database
    A column which is related to primary key in another table
Not Null > A column cannot contains any null values
Unique > A column cannot have any duplicate values
Default > if no value inserted set Default value
------------------------------------

> GoldenKey => primary key
> Empty Diamond > Normal column no relation and not even primary key
> Green Diamond> Not foreign and not Null
> Red Diamond > Not Null and foreign key

Benefits:
> Reduce storage space
> Reduece insert,update and deletion 
> improve query performance


What is 1NF
> No Repeated rows of data
> Colums only Conatins a single value
> The table has a primary key

What is 2NF
> They conform to 1NF
> Every column that is not a primary key of the table is 
  dependent on the whole of the primary key

What is 3NF
> They conform to 2NF
> Every column that is not a primary key  is only
  dependent on the whole of the primary key
